# Social Media Project

A bare-bones social media app that has similar features to that of 'Facebook' and 'Reddit'.
Users can register/login an account with an Email, Username and Password (Passwords are encrypted/hashed for security).
Users can create and view their profile as well as the profiles of others.
Users can create/update/view/delete 'Sections', 'Posts' and 'Comments'. Similar to that of 'Subreddits'
Users can add/block other users and send messages and receive notifications when doing so.
